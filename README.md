# 2ledsarduino

Second project of mine in a Arduino Uno R3.

For this masterpiece, you will require:
: 1 protoboard
: 2 leds ( any color you want )
: 4 jumpers
: 2 resistors ( 100 OHMS )
: 1 Arduino ( of course )
-----------------------------------------------

Connect 2 jumpers into the GND ( ground ) pin.
Connect 1 jumper of those jumpers in anywhere in
the protoboard. ( we will call that jumper "A" )
Connect the remaining jumper of those 2 jumpers 4/5
little dots from the protoboard away from the A jum
per.
( we will call this jumper "B" )
Do this with the remaining 2 jumpers. ( remaining 2 
jumpers have to be connected on the pins that are s
aying 13 and 12 )

Now, connect one 100 OHMS resistor 2 little protobo
ard dots and go to the left protoboard dot ( north,
 north and east)  above the A jumper and 2 little p
rotoboard dots above the B jumper.

Time for the LED now!

When you pick the LED, you can see one short "leg" 
and a taller "leg". You will connect the tall "le
g above the resistor.
You will have to do all that above but in 4 littl
e protoboard dots away from the B jumper.

Once you did all of it again but 4 little protobo
ard dots away from the B jumper, you can already 
plug in the Arduino in your laptop/PC, open the
code editor you use for Arduino, put in it the 
code inside code.c and upload it for your Arduino 
and see the result.

Happy coding! :)
